               The dedicated server does not control game parameters (deathmatch, skill level, etc). The first player to join a dedicated server becomes the "controller" and specifies the game parameters for all players</p>
Once all players quit a game running on a dedicated server, the server reverts to "listen" mode, waiting for new players to join. So you can start a new game without needing to restart the server. <a href="https://www.chocolate-doom.org/wiki/index.php/Multiplayer#Dedicated_server">ˢᵒᵘʳᶜᵉ</a>
